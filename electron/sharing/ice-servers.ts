/**
 * Single source of truth for WebRTC connectivity — ICE servers AND the rendezvous
 * trackers — shared by every P2P surface (share links, rooms, remote cast).
 * Previously each module carried its own copy and they drifted.
 *
 * STUN reveals each peer's public address (enough for most home NATs) and is
 * privacy-neutral. TURN would relay the (encrypted) traffic through a third party
 * so peers behind symmetric NAT can still connect — but we bundle NONE (see below).
 *
 * Connectivity ladder (zero-cost, see connectivity-strategy): direct/LAN/IPv6 →
 * STUN hole-punching → peer-relay through a reachable room member → optional
 * user-supplied TURN. The dev runs no servers; the only free external dependency
 * is the public WebRTC rendezvous trackers, which broker the handshake and never
 * see file bytes or plaintext.
 *
 * Keep in sync with the receiver pages (docs/share/index.html,
 * docs/watch/index.html) — those run in the browser and can't import this.
