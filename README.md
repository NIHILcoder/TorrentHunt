A modern, privacy-focused desktop BitTorrent client built with Electron, React and
WebTorrent. TorrentHunt ships ready to use — search the Internet Archive out of the
box — while keeping everything else opt-in and under your control.

> **Legal use only.** TorrentHunt does not bundle indexers for copyrighted material.
> Built-in sources point at public-domain / Creative Commons / open-source content
> (Internet Archive, FOSS Torrents). Any additional search providers or RSS feeds are
> added by you, and you are responsible for what you download and share.

## Download

Grab the latest Windows installer from the
**[Releases page](https://github.com/NIHILcoder/TorrentHunt/releases/latest)**.

### Verify your download

Every release is scanned with [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) and ships with
a SHA-256 checksum — both are listed in that release's notes. As an open-source desktop
app, the installer may trigger a SmartScreen "unknown publisher" prompt; verifying the
checksum confirms the file is genuine.

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\TorrentHunt-Setup-<version>.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

Compare the output against the SHA-256 published in the matching GitHub release.

## Features

### Downloads
- Add torrents via **.torrent file, magnet link, or drag & drop** — local files *and*
  remote `.torrent` URLs are supported
- Pause / resume / remove (with optional file deletion), retry failed downloads
- **Per-file selection & priority**, sequential download, per-torrent speed limits
- **Seed ratio / seed time limits**, tracker add/remove per torrent
- Categories, search/filter/sort, list & detailed views
- Open the OS "open with" dialog when you double-click a `.torrent` — no silent adds

### Discover content
- **Built-in Internet Archive search** — keyless, on-demand, public-domain & CC torrents
  (web-seeded, so they download even with no peers)
- **Pluggable search providers** — bring your own **Jackett**, **Prowlarr (Torznab)**, or
  a custom JSON API; test connectivity from the UI
- **RSS feeds** with auto-download, regex title filters and per-feed intervals; a few
  legal FOSS feeds are pre-seeded **disabled** (opt-in, no background traffic until you
  enable them) — plus one-click list cleanup

### Create & share
- Create torrents from files or folders (single or batch), custom trackers, private flag,
  start-seeding-immediately
- **Collaborative seeding** with a reputation/badge system

### Automation & networking
- **Scheduler** for time-based bandwidth/activity rules
- **Watch folder** — auto-add `.torrent` files dropped into a directory
- **IP blocklist** support
- **VPN detection** with a startup warning when no VPN is active
- Proxy configuration

### Desktop experience
- **Background mode** — closing the window minimizes to the **system tray** so torrents
  keep running; uses your `icon.ico`
- Run at login, close/minimize-to-tray, native completion notifications
- **Themes** (dark / light / system) with a clean monochrome design
- **Customizable hotkeys**
- **Localization** — English & Russian
- Settings export / import

### Privacy & security
- Context isolation, sandboxed renderer, Node integration disabled, type-safe IPC bridge
- Content-Security-Policy and navigation guards in production builds
- Privacy options: clear data on exit, ephemeral peer ID, log sanitization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 18+** and npm
- Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, or a modern Linux distribution

### Install
```bash
npm install
```

### Run in development
Starts the webpack dev server and Electron with hot reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build
```bash
npm run build        # compile main + renderer
npm run typecheck    # type-check both projects
npm run lint         # lint
```

### Package a desktop installer
```bash
npm run dist         # builds and packages (Windows NSIS by default)
```
Packaged output is written to `release/`.

## Architecture

### Download state machine
Downloads follow a validated lifecycle (`shared/state-machine.ts`):

```
QUEUED → DOWNLOADING → COMPLETED → SEEDING
   ↓         ↓            ↓           ↓
   └──────→ PAUSED ←──────┴───────────┘
             ↓
          ERROR → REMOVED
```
Invalid transitions are rejected to keep state consistent.

### Persistence
Downloads, settings, feeds, providers and reputation are stored locally via
**electron-store** (JSON). Progress is written on a debounced interval (batched into a
single write) to keep disk I/O low while torrents are active, so downloads resume after a
restart.

### Process & security model
- Renderer runs context-isolated and sandboxed; Node integration is disabled
- A minimal, type-safe preload bridge exposes only the IPC surface the UI needs
- Production builds apply a Content-Security-Policy and block in-app navigation to
  external origins (external links open in the default browser)

### Logging
Structured logs are written to the app's `logs/` directory with daily rotation,
multiple severity levels, and automatic cleanup of old files.

## Known Limitations

- **Speed limits** are applied best-effort via WebTorrent's throttling API and may vary by
  version. For strict control, use OS-level network management.
- **Peer statistics**: WebTorrent reports aggregate peers and does not cleanly separate
  seeds from leechers, so those numbers are approximate. For Internet Archive results the
  "seeds" column reflects download count (a popularity proxy), since the Archive does not
  expose swarm stats.

## Contributing

CI runs on every push / PR (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): type-check and build are required
gates; lint runs as advisory. Please run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` before
opening a PR.
